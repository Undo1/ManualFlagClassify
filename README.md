##ManualFlagClassify

A small project to help with two things:

 1. Classifying flags into groups, and
 2. Sanity

**This is not secure!** It's meant to be run locally behind a solid firewall, especially if you have real flag data in it. I would very much recommend not opening this up to the Internet unless you know what you're doing.
